    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>In today's digital world, website speed and storage are crucial. Heavy images slow down websites and take up unnecessary space. Our mission at <strong>ImgShrink</strong> (part of XizoaHub) is to make the web faster by providing a simple, free, and efficient tool that anyone can use to optimize their images for the web.</p>

    <h2>Why Choose ImgShrink?</h2>
    <div class="feature-box">
        <p><strong>1. 100% Privacy Focused:</strong> Unlike other tools, we do not upload your images to any server. All compression happens <strong>locally in your browser</strong>. This means your photos never leave your device.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Lightning Fast:</strong> Since there is no server upload time, the compression is instant.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Completely Free:</strong> We believe essential tools should be accessible to everyone.</p>
